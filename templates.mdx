Templates are pre-built database structures designed by the community to help you get started quickly. They provide ready-made solutions for common use cases, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

## What are Templates?

Think of templates as blueprints for your databases. They come with pre-configured fields, optimized descriptions, and thoughtful structures that are battle-tested by other users.

  Templates are starting points that you can customize to fit your exact needs. Use them as-is or modify them to match your workflow perfectly.

## Template vs. Custom Database

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use a Template When...">
    ✅ You have a common use case (tasks, contacts, projects)
    
    ✅ You want to get started immediately
    
    ✅ You're new to Hyperaide and want to learn by example
    
    ✅ You prefer proven structures over experimentation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Create Custom When...">
    ✅ Your workflow is unique or specialized
    
    ✅ You have specific requirements templates don't meet
    
    ✅ You want complete control over structure
    
    ✅ You're building something highly personalized
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Pro tip**: Start with a template and customize it! It's often easier to modify an existing structure than to build from scratch, even for unique workflows.
