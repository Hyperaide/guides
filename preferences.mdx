Preferences are personalized instructions that customize how your Hyperaide assistant interacts with you. They're like personality settings that shape your assistant's communication style, priorities, and working behavior.

## What are Preferences?

Preferences are simple text instructions that tell your assistant how you want to be treated. They can cover anything from communication style to behavioral patterns to language preferences.

<Info>
  Think of preferences as a set of rules or guidelines that your assistant always keeps in mind when working with you. They're included in every conversation, ensuring consistent behavior across all interactions.

## Preference vs. Instruction

It's important to understand the difference:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Preferences" icon="sliders">
    **Persistent rules** that apply to all interactions. They shape your assistant's overall behavior and personality.
    
    *Example*: "Always be concise"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Instructions" icon="terminal">
    **One-time requests** for specific actions. They're for immediate tasks, not ongoing behavior.
    
    *Example*: "Create a task to call Mom tomorrow"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Rule of thumb**: Use preferences for "how you work" and instructions for "what to do right now."
</Tip>

## Advanced Tips

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
