Welcome to Hyperaide! This guide will help you understand how to build and use your own personal AI assistant that connects all your tools.

## What is Hyperaide?

Hyperaide is a platform for creating a personal AI assistant that **integrates with the apps you already use**. Unlike generic assistants, Hyperaide connects your tools and lets you control them through natural conversation.

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect Hyperaide with your existing tools—Todoist, Linear, Google Calendar, Notion, GitHub, and more. Your assistant can read, create, and update items across all connected services using natural language.
    
    This is Hyperaide's superpower: unified control over all your apps through conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communication Channels" icon="message">
    Talk to your assistant through WhatsApp, Telegram, email, or the web app. All channels stay in sync, so you can message from your phone and continue the conversation on your computer.
    
    Your assistant is always accessible, wherever you are.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Databases" icon="table">
    For information not covered by integrations, create custom databases. These are flexible collections of structured data that you define—perfect for unique workflows or personal tracking needs.
    
    Think of databases as your personal information stores that complement your integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actions" icon="bolt">
    Your assistant can perform operations across all your integrations and databases. Create tasks in Todoist, schedule meetings in Google Calendar, track issues in Linear—all through natural conversation.
    
    Actions work across platforms, enabling powerful cross-tool workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Future Actions" icon="clock">
    Schedule automations to run at specific times or intervals. Your assistant can send morning summaries, create recurring tasks, sync data between tools, and more—all automatically.
    
    Set it once and your assistant handles it forever.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preferences" icon="sliders">
    Customize how your assistant behaves, communicates, and makes decisions. Set your language, tone, notification preferences, and behavioral rules to make the assistant work your way.

## Why Hyperaide?

Traditional productivity tools force you to adapt to their structure. Hyperaide is different—it adapts to you. With natural language processing and AI, you can:

- **Work naturally** - Just talk to your assistant like you would a human
- **Stay flexible** - Structure your databases however makes sense to you
- **Be everywhere** - Access your assistant from any device, any platform
- **Automate intelligently** - Let AI handle repetitive tasks while you focus on what matters

<Note>
  **New to AI assistants?** Don't worry! Hyperaide is designed to be intuitive. Start by creating your first database and asking your assistant to help you manage it. You'll be up and running in minutes.
