## What is Hyperaide?

Hyperaide is a platform for building your own personal AI assistant that **connects all your tools and works the way you do**. Unlike generic AI assistants, Hyperaide integrates with your existing apps and adapts to your workflow.

**Key Differentiator**: Hyperaide connects with WhatsApp, Telegram, Todoist, Linear, Google Calendar, Notion, GitHub, and more—letting you control everything through natural conversation.
