description: "Schedule tasks and automations your assistant performs automatically"
---

Future Actions are scheduled tasks and automations that your Hyperaide assistant executes automatically. Set it and forget it—your assistant handles the rest, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## What are Future Actions?

Future Actions are instructions you give your assistant to execute at specific times or on recurring schedules. They're like having a personal assistant who never forgets, never sleeps, and always follows through.

<Info>
  Future Actions transform your assistant from reactive (responding to your messages) to proactive (taking initiative based on your instructions).

## Creating Future Actions

Set up Future Actions using natural language—your assistant understands temporal expressions intuitively:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe What You Want">
    Tell your assistant what action to take: remind, create, update, notify, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Specify When">
    Describe when or how often: tomorrow, every week, on Mondays, monthly, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Details">
    Your assistant confirms the schedule and what will happen
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Execution">
    Your assistant handles the rest—no further action needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Actions">
    ```text
    "Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 2pm"
    "Create a task to review the proposal on Friday"

    "In 3 days, ask me if I followed up with the client"
    ```

## Managing Future Actions

You have complete visibility and control over all your Future Actions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="View All Actions">
    Navigate to **Future Actions** in the web app to see:
    
    - All scheduled actions
    - Recurring patterns
    - Next execution times
    - Execution history
    - Active vs. paused actions
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Edit Actions">
    Modify existing Future Actions:
    
    - Change schedule or frequency
    - Update the action to be performed
    - Adjust timing or conditions

  <Step title="View History">
    See a log of all executed Future Actions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Execution">
    Confirm actions ran at the right time with correct details

  <Step title="Adjust if Needed">
    Refine Future Actions based on actual results
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conditional Actions" icon="code-branch">
    Create actions that depend on conditions:
    
    *"If I have more than 10 overdue tasks, send me a priority review reminder"*
    
    *"When a project reaches 90% of its deadline, alert me if it's not complete"*
    
    *"If I haven't logged a workout in 3 days, send me a motivation message"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Chained Actions" icon="link">
    Create sequences of actions:
    
    *"Every Sunday: 1) Summarize last week, 2) Create next week's priorities, 3) Review upcoming deadlines"*
    
    Actions can trigger follow-up actions for complex workflows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Smart Scheduling" icon="brain">
    Let your assistant choose optimal timing:
    
    *"Remind me to call clients when I'm not busy, max once per day"*
    
    *"Send me task summaries when I typically check my messages"*
    
    Your assistant learns your patterns and schedules intelligently.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Context-Aware Actions" icon="lightbulb">
    Actions that consider your current state:
    
    *"If it's Monday and I have no meetings scheduled, remind me to set up check-ins"*
    
    *"When I mark a project complete, automatically create a retrospective task"*
    
    Actions that respond to your workflow dynamically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    Start each day with clarity and structure.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Evening Routine">
    ```text
    1. 6:00pm - "Summarize what I accomplished today"
    2. 6:30pm - "Show me incomplete tasks and help me decide what to defer"
    3. 7:00pm - "Plan tomorrow's top 3 priorities"
    ```
    
    End each day with closure and preparation.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Weekly Review">
    ```text
    1. Sunday 5pm - "List this week's completed tasks"
    2. Sunday 5:30pm - "Review progress on active projects"

    ```
    
    Maintain perspective and momentum weekly.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Project Automation">
    ```text
    1. Start of project - "Set up weekly check-in reminders"
    2. Weekly - "Review project progress and flag blockers"
    3. Midpoint - "Evaluate if we're on track and adjust plan"
    4. Near deadline - "Increase check-in frequency"
    5. Completion - "Create project retrospective task"
    ```
    
    Automate project management from start to finish.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Notifications & Delivery

Control how Future Actions notify you:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel Selection" icon="message">
    Choose which communication channel receives each notification:
    
    - Important reminders → WhatsApp
    - Daily summaries → Email  
    - Low-priority updates → Web app only
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Quiet Hours" icon="moon">
    Set times when Future Actions shouldn't notify you:
    
    - No notifications after 9pm
    - Sleep hours protected
    - Weekend modes available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batching" icon="layer-group">
    Group multiple Future Actions into single notifications:
    
    - Morning digest of all daily actions
    - Evening summary instead of individual pings
    - Reduced notification fatigue
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Action Didn't Run" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Future Action was paused
    - System maintenance window
    - Invalid or outdated instructions
    
    Check execution history and verify the action is active.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong Time Execution" icon="clock">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Timezone settings incorrect
    - Ambiguous time specification
    - Daylight saving time changes
    
    Verify your timezone in Settings and respecify the time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unexpected Results" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Ambiguous instructions
    - Context has changed since creation
    - Database structure updated
    
    Review and refine the action instructions for clarity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Future Actions execute automatically without confirmation. Be thoughtful about actions that delete, send messages, or make significant changes.
</Warning>

<Note>
  The real power of Future Actions emerges over time. As you build a library of automations, your assistant becomes increasingly proactive and you spend less time on manual coordination and more time on work that matters.
