Future Actions are tasks you schedule for your Hyperaide to do later. Tell your assistant what to do and when, and it handles the rest.

## What are Future Actions?

Future Actions are instructions your assistant executes at specific times—like reminders, recurring tasks, or scheduled check-ins.

<Info>
  Think of Future Actions as setting a reminder, but instead of just notifying you, your assistant actually does the work.

## Creating Future Actions

Just tell your assistant what you want and when. Use natural language:

```text
"Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 2pm"
"Every Monday morning, send me a summary of my tasks"
"In 3 days, check if I followed up with the client"
"On the 1st of each month, create a budget review task"
```

Your assistant understands:
- **Specific times**: "tomorrow at 3pm", "next Friday"
- **Recurring schedules**: "every Monday", "daily at 9am", "monthly"
- **Relative times**: "in 2 hours", "in 3 days"

## Managing Future Actions

View all your scheduled actions in the **Future Actions** page:

- See what's coming up and when
- Delete actions you no longer need
- Actions are sorted by execution time

## Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One-Time" icon="clock">
    "Remind me to review the proposal on Friday"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Daily" icon="sun">
    "Every morning at 8am, show me today's priorities"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Weekly" icon="calendar">
    "Every Sunday evening, plan the week ahead"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monthly" icon="calendar-check">
    "On the 15th, remind me to pay rent"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Future Actions run automatically—no need to confirm each time. Be specific with your instructions for best results.
