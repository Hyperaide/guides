Databases are the heart of Hyperaide. They are collections of structured information that help you organize and manage everything important to you.

## What are Databases?

Think of databases as smart, flexible storage containers for your information. You can create a database for tasks, projects, ideas, contacts, goals, habits—anything you want to track and manage.

<Info>
  **Example**: A tasks database might include fields like name, description, due date, and priority. A contacts database might include name, email, phone number, and relationship type.
</Info>

Each database you create can have its own set of fields, and you can link databases together to create powerful relationships between your information.

## Creating a Database

There are two ways to create a database in Hyperaide:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ask Your Assistant">
    The easiest way! Just tell your assistant what you want to track:
    
    - *"Create a database for my reading list"*
    - *"I need a database to track my workouts"*
    - *"Set up a projects database"*
    
    Your assistant will create the database and suggest relevant fields based on what you want to track.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Creation">
    For more control, create a database manually:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Databases** page in the web app
    2. Click **Create Database**
    3. Give your database a name and description
    4. Add fields with types and descriptions
    5. Save and start using it
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Database Fields

Each database contains fields—the individual pieces of information that make up a database record. Hyperaide supports several field types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text" icon="font">
    Store any text content like names, descriptions, notes, or URLs
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Number" icon="hashtag">
    Store numerical values for quantities, prices, ratings, or counts
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Date" icon="calendar">
    Store dates and times for deadlines, appointments, or timestamps
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Boolean" icon="toggle-on">
    Store yes/no values like completed status or flags
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Field Descriptions

Each field has a description that tells Hyperaide what the field is for and how to use it. This is crucial—think of it like a prompt that guides your assistant's understanding.

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Write clear, detailed field descriptions. Instead of "date," write "The due date when this task should be completed." Your assistant uses these descriptions to better understand your data.
</Tip>

## Database Descriptions

Your database itself also has a description. This description helps Hyperaide understand the purpose of the database and when to use it.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Description
"Tasks I need to complete, including personal and work-related items. Each task has a description, due date, priority level, and completion status. Use this database to track what I need to do and when."
```

```text Basic Description
"My tasks"
```
</CodeGroup>

The better your description, the better your assistant understands how to work with your data.

## Linking Databases

This is where Hyperaide becomes powerful. Database records can link to records in other databases automatically—no additional setup required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create related databases">
    For example, create both a "Tasks" and "Projects" database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tell your assistant to link them">
    Simply say: *"Link this task to the Website Redesign project"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Your assistant handles the rest">
    Hyperaide automatically creates and maintains the relationships
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Linking Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tasks → Projects">
    Link tasks to projects to organize work and track progress by project
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tasks → Contacts">
    Link tasks to people to remember who you need to follow up with
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Notes → Projects">
    Link notes and ideas to specific projects for easy reference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Habits → Goals">
    Link daily habits to longer-term goals to track progress
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Your Databases

Once your databases are set up, interact with them using natural language:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creating Records">
    ```text
    "Add a task to review the quarterly report by Friday"
    "Create a new project called Website Redesign"
    "Add John Smith to my contacts with email john@example.com"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Querying Records">
    ```text
    "Show me all tasks due this week"
    "What projects do I have in progress?"
    "Find all contacts in San Francisco"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Updating Records">
    ```text
    "Mark the design review task as complete"
    "Change the meeting time to 3pm"
    "Update the priority of the budget review to high"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bulk Operations">
    ```text
    "Mark all Q1 tasks as complete"
    "Archive all projects from last year"
    "Delete all contacts with no email address"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with basic databases and add complexity as needed. You can always add fields later.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Use clear field and database names. "Due Date" is better than "Date" or "Date1".
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rich Descriptions" icon="book">
    Write detailed descriptions for databases and fields. This helps your assistant understand your data better.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Link Strategically" icon="link">
    Connect related databases to create a knowledge graph of your life and work.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  Remember: There's no "right" way to structure your databases. Create what makes sense for your workflow and adjust as you learn what works best for you.
