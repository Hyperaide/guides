Energy powers everything your Hyperaide assistant does. Think of it as fuel—your assistant needs energy to perform actions, answer questions, and automate tasks on your behalf.

## What is Energy?

Every time your Hyperaide processes a message, creates a task, searches your databases, or performs any action, it consumes energy. Energy ensures your assistant has the resources it needs to work effectively.

<Info>
  Your assistant's energy determines how much work it can do before needing to be recharged. You can always check your current energy level and add more whenever you need.
</Info>

## Types of Energy

Hyperaide uses two types of energy to give you flexibility and control:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Base Energy" icon="battery-half">
    Your everyday working energy that refills with your subscription
    
    **Capacity:** 10,000 units max
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Permanent Energy" icon="battery-full">
    Additional energy you purchase that never expires
    
    **Capacity:** Unlimited
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Base Energy

Base energy is your assistant's core energy supply. It has a maximum capacity of **10,000 units** and is designed for regular day-to-day use.

<Tip>
  Base energy is like your assistant's working memory—it's what gets used first when performing tasks and actions.
</Tip>

### Permanent Energy

Permanent energy is bonus energy that you can purchase to expand your assistant's capabilities. Unlike base energy:

- **Never expires** - Once purchased, it's yours forever
- **No capacity limit** - Add as much as you need
- **Always available** - Acts as a reserve when your base energy runs low

<Note>
  Think of permanent energy as an energy reserve. It ensures your assistant never runs out of power, even during periods of heavy use.
</Note>

## How Energy is Used

Your assistant consumes energy when:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Processing Messages" icon="message">
    Every conversation with your assistant uses energy to understand your request and formulate a response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performing Actions" icon="bolt">
    Creating tasks, updating records, searching databases—all actions require energy to execute.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Running Automations" icon="clock">
    Future Actions and scheduled automations consume energy each time they run.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration Operations" icon="plug">
    Syncing with external tools like Todoist, Linear, or Google Calendar uses energy.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Viewing Your Energy

You can see your current energy levels in the Energy page of your Hyperaide dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Energy">
    Click on the Energy tab in your dashboard sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Your Levels">
    You'll see a visual bar showing both your base energy and permanent energy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Usage">
    The display shows exactly how many units you have available
  </Step>
</Steps>

The energy bar shows:
- **Base energy** (amber) - Your current working energy out of 10,000 units
- **Permanent energy** (orange) - Your additional permanent reserve
- **Dividers** - Marks every 1,000 units for easy reading

## Purchasing Energy

You can purchase permanent energy anytime to ensure your assistant always has power. There are three flexible ways to buy:

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitor Regularly" icon="chart-line">
    Check your energy levels periodically, especially if you use automations heavily.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Buy in Advance" icon="clock">
    Purchase permanent energy before you run low to avoid interruptions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Consider Your Usage" icon="gauge">
    Heavy automation users may benefit from buying larger amounts of permanent energy upfront.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Budget-Friendly" icon="piggy-bank">
    Start with the minimum ($5) to test your usage patterns before buying more.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of energy?" icon="circle-question">
    If your energy reaches zero, your assistant won't be able to process new requests or run automations until you add more. Your data and settings remain safe—you just need to purchase more energy to continue.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does permanent energy expire?" icon="hourglass">
    No! Permanent energy never expires. Once purchased, it's available to your assistant forever.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which energy is used first?" icon="battery-quarter">
    Your assistant uses base energy first. Permanent energy acts as a reserve and is only consumed after your base energy is depleted.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund on energy purchases?" icon="rotate-left">
    Energy purchases are final and non-refundable since they're immediately added to your account. However, they never expire, so you can always use them later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much energy do I need?" icon="calculator">
    Usage varies based on how actively you use your assistant. Most users find that monitoring their usage for a week gives them a good sense of their needs. Start small and add more as needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a maximum I can purchase?" icon="arrow-up">
    No maximum! You can purchase as much permanent energy as you want. The minimum purchase is $5 (2,500 units), but there's no upper limit.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Make sure you're logged into your Hyperaide account when purchasing energy. Energy is tied to your specific account and cannot be transferred.
</Warning>

## Managing Your Energy

The Energy page gives you complete visibility and control:

- **Real-time display** - See exactly how much energy you have at any moment
- **Visual breakdown** - Clearly distinguish between base and permanent energy
- **Easy purchasing** - Buy more energy in just a few clicks
