Integrations are what make Hyperaide truly powerful. Connect your assistant to the tools you already use—task managers, calendars, communication platforms, and more—to create a unified productivity hub.

## What are Integrations?

Integrations allow Hyperaide to interact with external services on your behalf. Your assistant can:

- **Read data** from connected services (tasks, events, issues, etc.)
- **Create and update** items across platforms
- **Sync information** between your services and Hyperaide databases
- **Automate workflows** that span multiple tools

<Info>
  Once connected, your assistant can manage these services using natural language, just like it manages your Hyperaide databases.

## How Integrations Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Account">
    Authorize Hyperaide to access your external service with OAuth
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose What to Sync">
    Select which projects, calendars, or spaces to make available
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Talk Naturally">
    Your assistant can now access and manage data from that service
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automate Workflows">
    Create Future Actions that work across multiple integrations
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Use Integrations?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unified Interface" icon="grid">
    Manage all your tools from one place—talk to your assistant instead of switching between apps.
    
    *"Show me all my tasks from Todoist and Linear"*  
    *"What's on my Google Calendar tomorrow?"*  
    *"Create a GitHub issue for this bug I found"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cross-Platform Workflows" icon="diagram-project">
    Create automations that span multiple services:
    
    *"When I complete a task in Todoist, add a note to my daily journal"*  
    *"Every morning, show me today's calendar and top 3 Linear issues"*  
    *"If a GitHub issue is assigned to me, create a task in my Hyperaide database"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Natural Language Control" icon="message-bot">
    No need to learn each app's interface or shortcuts. Use natural language:
    
    *"Move all my overdue Todoist tasks to next Monday"*  
    *"Block 2 hours on my calendar tomorrow for deep work"*  
    *"What Notion pages did I update this week?"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Centralized Knowledge" icon="brain">
    Your assistant understands context across all services:
    
    *"What's the status of the website redesign project?"* (pulls from Linear, Notion, and your databases)  
    *"Show me everything related to client XYZ"* (finds tasks, calendar events, and notes)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration Permissions

<Warning>
  Integrations require access to your external accounts. Hyperaide only requests the minimum permissions needed to function and never accesses data you don't explicitly authorize.
</Warning>

### What Hyperaide Can Access

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read Permissions" icon="eye">
    - View tasks, events, issues, or pages you select
    - Read metadata (names, dates, status, etc.)
    - Access data only from projects/spaces you authorize
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write Permissions" icon="pen">
    - Create new items (tasks, events, notes)
    - Update existing items (status, descriptions, dates)
    - Only when you explicitly ask the assistant to do so
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What Hyperaide CANNOT Do" icon="shield-xmark">
    - Access data from unauthorized projects/spaces
    - Make changes without your instruction
    - Share your data with third parties
    - Delete items (unless you explicitly request it)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Integrations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="View Connections">
    See all active integrations in **Settings → Integrations**:
    
    - Connection status (active, expired, error)
    - Last sync time
    - Permissions granted
    - Data being accessed
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reconnect">
    If an integration stops working:
    
    1. Go to the integration settings
    2. Click **Reconnect**
    3. Re-authorize access
    4. Your assistant resumes access
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Disconnect">
    To remove an integration:
    
    1. Go to integration settings
    2. Click **Disconnect**
    3. Confirm removal
    4. Hyperaide immediately loses access
    
    <Info>
      Your Hyperaide databases are unaffected—only the connection to the external service is removed.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reconfigure">
    Adjust integration settings:
    
    - Change which projects/calendars to sync
    - Update sync frequency
    - Modify notification preferences
    - Set up custom mapping rules
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration Not Working" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible solutions:**
    - Check connection status in Settings
    - Try reconnecting the integration
    - Verify you still have access to the external service
    - Check if the service is experiencing downtime
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Not Syncing" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Possible solutions:**
    - Wait a few moments (sync can take 30-60 seconds)
    - Manually trigger a sync in integration settings
    - Check that you authorized the correct account
    - Verify the data exists in the external service
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authorization Expired" icon="key">
    **Solution:**
    Many services require periodic re-authorization for security:
    
    1. You'll see an "Expired" status in Settings
    2. Click **Reconnect** and re-authorize
    3. Your integration resumes working immediately
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Permissions" icon="lock">
    **Solution:**
    If your assistant can't perform an action:
    
    1. Check what permissions were granted
    2. Disconnect and reconnect with fuller permissions
    3. Ensure you have access in the external service
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Check Permissions" icon="shield-check">
    Review what access each integration has and adjust as needed.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test Workflows" icon="flask">
    Experiment with commands before creating automations to ensure they work as expected.
