## Overview

The Hyperaide API allows you to programmatically interact with your assistant, enabling integrations with external services, custom automations, and advanced workflows.

## Base URL

```
https://api.hyperaide.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to the Hyperaide web app
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secure!** Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Core Endpoints

The Hyperaide API provides two primary endpoints for interacting with your assistant:

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |

| `500` | Internal Server Error |

Error responses include a JSON body with details:

```json
{
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "Detailed error message"
}
```
