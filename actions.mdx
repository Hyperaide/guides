description: "What your Hyperaide assistant can do for you"
---

Actions are the operations your Hyperaide assistant can perform on your databases and workflows. They transform your assistant from a passive information store into an active productivity partner.

## What are Actions?

Actions are built-in capabilities that allow your assistant to interact with your data. Rather than just storing information, your assistant can create, update, search, and manipulate records across all your databases.

<Info>
  You don't need to set up or configure actions—they're automatically available for all your databases once you create them.
</Info>

## Core Actions

Your assistant comes with powerful built-in actions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Records" icon="plus">
    Add new items to any database with natural language
    
    *"Add a task to review the quarterly report by Friday"*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Update Records" icon="pen">
    Modify existing entries easily
    
    *"Mark the design review task as complete"*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Query & Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Find information across all your databases
    
    *"Show me all tasks due this week"*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delete Records" icon="trash">
    Remove items you no longer need
    
    *"Delete all completed tasks from last month"*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Link Records" icon="link">
    Connect related items across databases
    
    *"Link this task to the Website Redesign project"*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bulk Operations" icon="layer-group">
    Perform actions on multiple records at once
    
    *"Mark all Q1 project tasks as archived"*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Actions Work

When you send a message to your assistant, it analyzes your intent and determines which actions to take:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Natural Language Processing">
    You send a message in plain language: *"Add a task to call the client tomorrow"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intent Recognition">
    Your assistant understands you want to create a new record in the tasks database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Execution">
    The assistant executes the create action with the appropriate data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You receive confirmation that the action was completed successfully
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Records

Add new records to your databases conversationally:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tasks">
    ```text
    "Add a task to review the budget by Friday"
    "Create a task: call Mom tomorrow at 3pm"
    "New task - finish the presentation, high priority"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Projects">
    ```text
    "Create a new project called Website Redesign"
    "Start a project for the Q2 marketing campaign"
    "Add a project: Mobile App Development"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contacts">
    ```text
    "Add John Smith to my contacts with email john@example.com"
    "Create a contact for Sarah Johnson, she's a client"
    "New contact: Mike Brown, phone: 555-1234"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Notes">
    ```text
    "Create a note about today's meeting with the title 'Q1 Planning'"
    "Add a note: Remember to check on the server migration"
    "Save this idea: What if we gamified the onboarding?"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Your assistant is smart about understanding context. If you mention "tomorrow," "next week," or "Friday," it automatically calculates the correct date.
</Tip>

## Updating Records

Modify existing records naturally:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status Updates" icon="toggle-on">
    ```text
    "Mark the design review task as complete"
    "Change the project status to in progress"
    "Set the priority of the budget review to high"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Field Changes" icon="pen-field">
    ```text
    "Change the meeting time to 3pm"
    "Update the description of the website project"
    "Move the task deadline to next Friday"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adding Information" icon="circle-plus">
    ```text
    "Add a note to the client meeting task about what was discussed"
    "Include Sarah's phone number in her contact"
    "Update the project with today's progress"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Querying Records

Search and retrieve information from your databases:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Queries">
    ```text
    "Show me all my tasks"
    "What tasks are due this week?"
    "List all my projects"
    "Find contacts in San Francisco"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Filtered Queries">
    ```text
    "Show me high priority tasks due this week"
    "What tasks are assigned to the Marketing project?"
    "Find all contacts who are clients"
    "List incomplete tasks older than 30 days"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Complex Queries">
    ```text
    "Show me tasks due soon that are linked to active projects"
    "What projects have no tasks assigned to them?"
    "Find all contacts I haven't interacted with in 3 months"
    "List tasks created last week that are still incomplete"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Aggregations">
    ```text
    "How many tasks do I have in total?"
    "What percentage of my tasks are complete?"
    "Show me my most active projects by task count"
    "How many contacts do I have by category?"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Linking Records

Create relationships between records in different databases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Related Items">
    You have a task that belongs to a project, or a note that relates to a contact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request the Link">
    *"Link the design task to the Website Redesign project"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Connection">
    Your assistant creates the relationship automatically
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Query Connected Data">
    *"Show me all tasks for the Website Redesign project"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Links work bidirectionally. If you link a task to a project, you can query tasks from the project OR query the project from the task.
</Info>

## Bulk Operations

Perform actions on multiple records simultaneously:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bulk Updates" icon="pen-to-square">
    ```text
    "Mark all tasks in the Q1 project as complete"
    "Change all high priority tasks to medium priority"
    "Set all contacts in New York to category: East Coast"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Deletion" icon="trash-can">
    ```text
    "Delete all completed tasks from last year"
    "Remove all tasks with no due date"
    "Clear all archived projects"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Creation" icon="clone">
    ```text
    "Create tasks for each step in the project plan"
    "Add a weekly review task for the next 4 weeks"
    "Generate contacts from this email list"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Linking" icon="link-horizontal">
    ```text
    "Link all design tasks to the Website Redesign project"
    "Connect all Q1 notes to the quarterly review project"
    "Associate all client contacts with the Sales project"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Bulk operations are powerful but irreversible. Your assistant will typically ask for confirmation before executing bulk deletions or updates.
</Warning>

## Action Workflows

Combine actions to create powerful workflows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Task Management">
    **Daily Review Workflow**
    
    1. "Show me all tasks due today"
    2. "Mark the completed ones as done"
    3. "Reschedule any remaining ones to tomorrow"
    4. "Create a summary of what I accomplished"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Project Planning">
    **New Project Setup**
    
    1. "Create a project called Mobile App Launch"
    2. "Add tasks for design, development, testing, and marketing"
    3. "Link all tasks to the Mobile App Launch project"
    4. "Set deadlines for each phase"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contact Management">
    **Relationship Maintenance**
    
    1. "Show contacts I haven't talked to in 2 months"
    2. "Create follow-up tasks for the top 5"
    3. "Add notes about what to discuss with each"
    4. "Schedule reminders for next week"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Data Cleanup">
    **Database Maintenance**
    
    1. "Find all tasks with no due date"
    2. "Ask me about each one"
    3. "Either set a due date or delete it"
    4. "Summarize what was cleaned up"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Smart Context Understanding

Your assistant understands context and can chain actions intelligently:

<CodeGroup>
```text Example 1
You: "Create a project for the website redesign"
Assistant: ✓ Created project "Website Redesign"

You: "Add tasks for it: design mockups, develop frontend, test on mobile"
Assistant: ✓ Created 3 tasks and linked them to Website Redesign
```

```text Example 2
You: "Show me tasks due this week"
Assistant: Here are your 5 tasks due this week...

You: "Mark the first two as complete"
Assistant: ✓ Marked "Review budget" and "Call client" as complete
```

```text Example 3
You: "I met with John today to discuss the project"
Assistant: ✓ Created interaction record and linked to John Smith
          ✓ Added note to Website Redesign project
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    The more specific your request, the better the result. Include relevant details like dates, priorities, and categories.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Natural Language" icon="comments">
    Don't worry about syntax or commands. Talk to your assistant like you would a human colleague.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Confirm Bulk Actions" icon="shield-check">
    Review what will be affected before confirming bulk operations, especially deletions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Link Related Data" icon="sitemap">
    Create connections between records to build a rich, queryable knowledge graph.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Remember: Actions are just tools your assistant uses to help you. Focus on **what** you want to accomplish, not **how** to do it. Your assistant figures out the right actions to take.
