## Smart Features

- **Automatic team detection**: Mentions project names to assign correct team
- **Status mapping**: Understands "todo", "in progress", "done" etc.
- **Priority intelligence**: Maps "urgent", "high", "normal", "low"
- **Issue linking**: Connect Linear issues to Hyperaide tasks

## Example Workflows

```text
Morning Standup:
"Show my Linear issues for today and what I completed yesterday"

Bug Triage:
"When someone mentions 'bug' in Slack, create a Linear issue"

Project Status:
"Every Friday, summarize Linear progress for all projects"

Issue Sync:
"When I complete a Linear issue, mark the related task as done"
```

<Note>
  Linear integration is perfect for development teams wanting natural language control over their project management workflow.
