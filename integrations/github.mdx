## Smart Features

- **Label detection**: Understands bug, feature, enhancement labels
- **Assignee mentions**: "@john" assigns to team members
- **Milestone tracking**: Links issues to milestones automatically
- **Status awareness**: Knows open, closed, merged states

## Example Workflows

```text
Daily Standup:
"Show my GitHub activity from yesterday and today's planned work"

Code Review:
"Every morning, show PRs waiting for my review"

Bug Triage:
"When a critical bug is mentioned, create a GitHub issue immediately"

Release Prep:
"Before each release, show all issues in the milestone"
```

<Note>
  GitHub integration is essential for developers who want to stay on top of their repositories without constantly checking GitHub.
